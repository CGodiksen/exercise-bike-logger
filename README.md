# Exercise bike assistant
Desktop application for iConsole compatible exercise bikes, created using PyQT. Connects with the exercise bike through bluetooth and lets the user start a new workout and see live data while the workout is ongoing. When a workout is finished it is automatically logged and added to the workout history which shows every workout session completed through the application. Statistics related to the workout history as a whole can also be seen to give a more comprehensive look at the progression of the users workouts.
